Fifty-five athletes will be competing in paragliding under the Eighth National Games scheduled at different places of state 5 from April 18. According to the National Sports Council, the paragliding competition would be organized at Pokhara from April 19 as there are no physical infrastructures in state 5 for the same. Paragliding has been included in the National Games for the first time in its history. General Secretary at the Nepal Paragliding and Hang Gliding Association, Shailendra Raut, said that Nepal Army and 46 men and nine women would compete for six gold medals. A team of 14 athletes including 10 men and four women from Tribhuvan Army Club are competing in paragliding.
