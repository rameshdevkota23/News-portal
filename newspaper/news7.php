			      	The final decision on the elections will be taken after final consultation with constitutional experts, intra-party discussions, and all-party meeting, according to a coalition leader.

CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal had recently proposed to hold parliamentary elections in April-May and local election in November-December pointing that CPM-UML has been obstructing the House.

"We have concluded that parliamentary elections cannot be held in April-May as the five-year term of House expires only in March 2023 and the Supreme Court verdict has also stated that the House should compete its full term," the leader explained.

The leader stated that the three elections will be held together as far as possible. "Holding all the elections together will require lower expenses and the state has to bear lesser financial burden."

The provincial and federal elections were last held on November 26 and December 7, 2017 in two stages. The Election Commission had announced final results only on February 14, 2018 as the National Assembly election had to be first held before picking House fo Representatives (HoR) members through the proportional representation (PR) system to ensure that the federal parliament is inclusive as required by the Constituion.

KP Sharma Oli was appointed prime minister on February 15, 2018 and the first session of the HoR and National Assembly started 18 days later.

The term of local bodies, however, finishes before that. The local election were held in three stages in May, June and September 2017.

There are two provisions about local bodies and their members in the Constitution. Article 215 states that the term of heads and deputy heads, ward chairs and members of local bodies will be five years.
